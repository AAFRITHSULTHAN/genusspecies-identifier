🔍 Project Overview

Identifying taxonomic names in biological literature is a critical but time-consuming task.
This project leverages TaxoNERD, a state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) model specialized for taxonomy, to automatically detect and classify organism names from raw text.

The system is suitable for:

Biodiversity research

Biological text mining

Academic datasets

AI-powered bioinformatics tools

🧠 How It Works

Input biological or scientific text

Text is processed through TaxoNERD

The model identifies:

Genus

Species

Other taxonomic ranks

Structured output is generated for analysis or storage

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

AI / NLP: TaxoNERD

Libraries: spaCy, Transformers

Deployment: API-ready / research-friendly

Use Cases: Bioinformatics, taxonomy extraction, academic research

🧪 Example Input & Output
Input
The Panthera tigris is found in tropical forests and grasslands.

Output
{
  "Genus": "Panthera",
  "Species": "Panthera tigris"
}

📂 Features
